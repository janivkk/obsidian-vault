The recap for networking fundamentals from Year 2.

`Network` → A collection of nodes that can communicate with one another.

In cybersecurity it’s not only about nodes or devices but people as well.

`Topologies` → Bus, Star, Hybrid, Tree, Mesh, Ring, Extended Star

`OSI 7-layer model` → Networking, Application, Transportation, Data Link, Physical, Session and Presentation (not in order)

-   What is data communication e.g., how does a data packet travel through each layer?
