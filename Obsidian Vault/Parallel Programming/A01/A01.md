### Roadmap:
Ways to achieve a higher grade i.e., 1st grade. 

- According to James, the program should/could support 16bit colour for both greyscale and coloured images.

### Assignment:
Your task is to develop a digital image enhancement program that will perform contrast adjustment using the histogram equalisation algorithm. The algorithm uses a cumulative intensity histogram to back-project original image intensities resulting in an image of equalised intensities. The algorithm is described in detail in [1].

![[Pasted image 20230212132452.png]]
- Calculate an intensity histogram from the input image **(Fig. 1b)**
- Calculate a cumulative histogram **(Fig. 1c)**
- Normalise and scale the cumulative histogram **(Fig. 1d)**: the cumulative frequencies are normalised and scaled to represent output image intensities (e.g. from 0-255 for an 8-bit image).
- Back-projection: the normalised cumulative histogram is used as a look-up table (LUT) for mapping of the original intensities onto the output image. For each output pixel, the algorithm should use the original intensity level as an index into the LUT and assign the intensity value stored at that index.
- The output should be an intensity equalised image **(Fig. 1e)**.

Due the large amount of data, all image processing must be performed on parallel hardware and implemented by parallel software written in OpenCL with C++. You should develop your own device code (i.e. kernels) that perform the main steps of the algorithm. The steps include several classic parallel patterns including scan, histogram, and map. Your program should also report memory transfer, kernel execution, and total program execution times for performance assessment.

All host-side image I/O operations (i.e. reading, displaying of images) are not assessed and can be based on the code provided during the workshop tutorials. You may use any code and libraries provided/developed during the workshop sessions, but you must not use any additional pre-existing libraries for this purpose.  
  
The basic version of your program can be based on purely atomic calculations of the intensity and cumulative histograms, work with 8-bit intensity monochrome images, and use a pre-determined number of bins (i.e. 256). Further credit will be given for additional functionality such as efficient parallel implementation of the histogram based on local memory, variable bin number/size, different parallel variants of the scan pattern, and support for colour images. In such a case, your program should run and display execution times for different variants of your algorithms.

**Dataset:**

Two test images of different sizes are provided together with this assessment brief. Your code will also be tested on “unseen” images, such as colour and 16-bit depth examples to test the extra functionality of your program.

**Assignment Deliverables:**

1)    The main assessment criteria for this task are related to the correctness of the developed parallel algorithms and the effectiveness of optimisation strategies. The code should be well-commented and clearly structured into functional blocks.


2)    You are also required to provide an executive summary of your implementation (max. 4 A4 pages). This should briefly describe and comment the different code section and the implemented functionality, clearly indicate any original developments in the code (beyond what was provided in the workshops), cite any external sources used, and detail the optimisation strategies employed and the improvements you achieved. You should also add tables and graphs to show the results and compare the impact of optimizations and algorithm selection.

Your grade will depend on the quality of your code (70%), and the completeness in executive summary (30%). Keep the executive summary concise and do not exceed the page limit.

Please see the Criterion Reference Grid for details of how the presentation will be graded.
